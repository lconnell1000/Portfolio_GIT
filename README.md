# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## The Project

For this project we had to create a portfolio from scratch to put our work into. As we haven't completed many projects yet, I was only able to include 2 of my own work and used other various webpages, which at a later date in the course will be updated to show my own work *update 11/3/22, now shows exclusively my own work. The porfolio was to include the following things: My name, a photo of me, links to sections about me & my work & contact me and a my work section, with links to deployed application's if applicable, or a video walk through of non deployed applications.

## Finished Product
