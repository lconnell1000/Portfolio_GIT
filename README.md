# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## The Project

For this project we had to create a portfolio from scratch to put our work into. As we haven't completed many projects yet, I was only able to include 2 of my own work and used other various webpages, which at a later date in the course will be updated to show my own work. The porfolio was to include the following things: My name, a photo of me, links to sections about me & my work & contact me, a my work section where the first image is larger in size than the others, when you click an image application you should be taken to the deployed webpage and last of all when you resize the webpage the layout needs to be resposive.

## Mock Up
